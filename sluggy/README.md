# Sluggy

**Sluggy** is a simple virus that uses ``PIL`` and ``Tkinter``. 
It takes a screenshot of your screen, puts it on your screen and waits for a second, essentially bricking your PC every second.
You might be able to write "hhhhheeeeeellllllpppppp" in your browser but that's really all you can do.

Close with Alt+F4.
